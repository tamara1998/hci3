			<h3>Assignment</h3>
				<p>
				 	For the assignment we have to come up with an idea for a social playfull interaction to encourage positive behaviour within the main THUAS building. This means I have to come up with a concept that will let people interact with eachother in a positive and playfull interactive way.
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 	My idea for this concept is to have an compliment battle within the whole school. In the main building there will be an interactive screen were all of the compliments for people will be uploaded. All of the students and teachers will have to download an app were they can receive the compliments and upload compliments on too the screen. When the person walks by the compliment is intended for they will receive this and will have too upload an new compliment for somebody else.
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 	The make it more of an game the person who gives out the most compliments at the end of the day will receive an reward. This could be a free coffee or a hoodie with the school logo on it. At the end of the day the system will clear out the scorebord so people can start over the next day but the compliments you have gotten and given out will be saved within the app and will be organized by day. So you can easily look back and see which compliments you gave out and received on each day.
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 	The play modus for this game is multiplayer, competitive and parallel. The play modus is multiplayer because I want everyone the participate within the game and it is more fun if you can receive more compliments from different people. The play modus is competitive because people won't start giving compliments out without an incentive so the have more people compliment eachother you can win something at the end of the day if you come out on top. As the last the reason for a parellel play modus is that people know that they are competing with eachother and are aware that other people are doing the same as them. 
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 	The concept will work technically with an interactive screen that will be placed in the main building of THUAS. On this screen the compliments will be displayed and you can click on them to see who sent it and how many they have sent and for who it is. You get the comlpiments on your phone when you walk by the screen. You can upload the compliments from your phone and you can see who is on top on the leaderbord that is in the app. 
				</p>
			<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>
					The video I chose for the research part is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCBUMfYh8lQ&t=4s">drums anywhere</a>. This video is about turning anything into a drumset. In the video you see the person turning a table into a drumset and it works. The purpose of the interface is to have a drumset that can be anything. It could be a table, a door or books. As long as you have a surface that you can contect too you have a working drumkit. It works with virtual pads that are on your computer and it is velocity sensitive. Once you have conected the microphone to your table and your computer you have a drumkit. It reacts to the sound you make and turns it into the part of the drumkit it is assigned to.
				</p>
				<p>
					The playmodus is single player because you can't play a drunmkit with two people. It is an cooperative play modus because you work with the program to make it work. As last it is a knowing play modus because you have to know how to play a drumkit.
				</p>
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					I think it is an interessting topic and I wouldn't have come to know about it if I hadn't taken this course. It is interessting in how many ways you can make someting an playfull interface and how simple it can be. I think in the future it is gonna be used more because we are slowly working towards more realistic games were we, the players, can interact with the interface without controlers or a smartphone perhaps just your body and the sensors just for the interface. The subject met my expectations it was interessting and I learned something new when I was in the lecture and when I was making the assignment.
