			<h3>Assignment</h3>
				<p>
				 	For the assignment we have to apply the Homeostasis model to a device of our choice. I chose to apply it to a printer because it is a device that we use everyday and it seemed fun to think deeper about it.
				</p>
				<p>
				 	For a printer to function it firstly needs power before it can do anything otherwise it will just do nothing. Besides power it needs cartridges so it can fulfill its duty of printing things for you. To print it also needs paper so it can print the ink of the cartridges on to the page so you can see what you printed. A printer can’t do all of this by itself it needs help from the outside to perform. So what the printer needs from the outside is a computer or an picture. The computer is for delivering print assignments to the printer so it knows what to print otherwise it can’t do anything. The picture or text is for copying if you already have a physical copy, you can make another copy with the printer and this way it can also do the functions it was made to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first example for how it can function with the outside stimuli and actions is printing an document you had to make for school or work. You connect your laptop to the printer so it can send the document over to the printer and when the printer receives this document it can start fulfilling this task. The second example is you have to make an copy of your passport so you put it in your printer and it will scan it for you. Then you press the print button so it can print it for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					A printer behaves like an creature because without the help of people it can’t function or do what it needs to do.
				</p>
			<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>
					For the research part of this assignment I looked if I could find an artificial creature that wasn't mentioned in the lecture.
				</p>
				<p>
					I went online and found an article from 2009 about <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16996-bionic-penguins-take-to-the-water--and-the-skies/">bionic penguins</a>, they look like real penguins and can communicate like real ones but are Artificial Creatures. They were made by German engineering firm <a href="https://www.festo.com/cms/nl_nl/index.htm">Festo</a> and this firm also made lager ones that are filled with helium and can “swim” through the air. Every penguin has an 3d sonar developed by <a href="https://www.evologics.de/">EvoLogics</a> so it won’t collide with walls or the other penguins. 
					<br>
					I think this very impressive because they move and look just like there living counterparts but are entirely robotic. It’s relevant to the topic Artificial Creatures because it literally are Artificial Creatures. They are an robotic version of real penguins and do everything just the same the only difference is that they are not real beings.
				</p>
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					I think Artificial Creatures is one of the most interesting topics we got in this course. The idea that we can create something that has intelegence of it's own is mind bogling. I think the future of artificial creatures is bright and will have a lot of progress made in the coming years. I think everyone will have some form of artificial creature in there house in the near future. This subject met more then my expectations and I can't wait to see what people will create during the lab weeks that have this topic.
