			<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
				 	Hello my name is Tamara and I an student at The Hague University of aplied sciences. I am an twenty year old with an passion for English literature and photography. In me free time I love to read and drink coffee, my favorite place in the world is London and I love graphic design.
				</p>
			<h3>Expactions</h3>
				<p>
					My expactations for this course is that it's going to be a lot of fun to do but that there will be moments were I won't know what I am doing and that I am going to feel stressed but in the end will be worth it. But over all I think it's gonna be a fun experience and that I am going too learn alot of new things and a lot of new people.
				</p>
			<h3>What am I hoping to learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I am hoping to learn more about the different topics that we will be discussing durings this course. I am most excited to start working with the arduino board because it's something I want to get better at because last year it didn't go so well. Besides that I am really excited to learn more about artificial creatures because that is something that has held my interest since doing HCI last year and I can't wait to learn new things about it this time around and use the knowledge I picked up last year.
