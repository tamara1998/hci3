			<h3>Assignment</h3>
				<p>
					For AR and VR we have to come up with different ideas for three different topis were AR and VR may be used in the future and how it could be used in that field. 
				</p>
				 <h4 class="education">Education</h4>
					<p>
						Technology is constantly changing to make life easier for people. Education could use some technology to make it easier for its students. So with applying AR technology to education a lot could change. My concept idea is that instead of seeing pictures in books and screens. Students could see them in real time through the lens of their phone. The idea is with the use of Augmented Reality we could layer a virtual image over the real word were the students could interact with. Think of something along the lines of Pokémon go but then in an educative way. Students could click on what they are seeing and interact it with instead of looking at a flat picture in a text book. This way lessons while become more fun and students will start paying more attention to what they are learning. Down below is a picture of Pokémon Go to illustrate the idea of using it in a class room.

				<h4 class="education">Therapy</h4>
					<p>
						So a lot of people go to therapy to get help with dealing with fears or problems. A good way to deal with your fears is to confront them but a real thing is not always the best option. So by introducing VR glasses that can help with this would be a major breakthrough. When you try to help people with doing it in VR they get the feel of the real thing without it being real. So they can work up to getting to the real thing. It works with VR glasses and an program where you can adjust to the fear and or problem for the person that is going to use it. Down below you can find an example of how it can look.

				<h4 class="education">Art and Museum</h4>
					<p>
						More and more museums are getting interactive so the next step is applying something like AR in a museum. My idea for a concept is something like my first concept for education. The concept is that with your phone using an app that will put an AR layer over the real world to unlock special features on paintings and sculptures. These special features will give you extra information on the art your seeing. This you can do with your phone, all you have to do is click on the art and animations and information bubbles will pop up. Down below you can see a picture to illustrate the idea of the concept.

			<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>
					A fun and interessting project that has been in the works for a year now is the new AR game <a href="https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com/en/enlist/">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a>. It was anouced last year that the new game company Portkey Games was going to make two Harry Potter games. One was Harry Potter: Hogwarts a Mystery which is a story mode game were you have a main storyline you follow and side quest you can do. This game has been doing very well now they are promting there newest game which brings the wizarding world to our world. This is done with AR technology that puts an magical filter of our world and let's you help save the wizarding world from exposure. What I find interessting about this project is how much thought they put into it. With the promotions they have created a story arround it that will pull Harry Potter fans into downloading the game and play it. 
				</p>
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					I think the topic of AR and VR is very interessting it is an immersive way to play games and feel like you are literally in the game. That is with VR more that AR but it stays the same it is amazing to see how far technology has come and what it can do now a days. I think that we are going to use AR and VR more and more in the future it will start simple with to use it in schools and in hospitals and it is going to slowly expand more and more into our everyday lives. The subject met my expectations I learned about different AR and VR projects and how much you already can do with it.
