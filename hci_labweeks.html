				For the class HCI Technologies with Labweeks from June 3rd 2019 until June 14th 2019. During these two weeks I worked with my group on a project under the topic Augemented and Virtual Reality. Augmented Reality (AR) is a second layer over our own world when you use those kinds of apps, examples are Pok√©mon Go or Harry Potter Wizards Unite. This are games that use the camera of your phone an in a way puts a filter of our world so you can see their world layed over our world. Virtual Reality is when you get imersed into a new world created by someone else you can do this with Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift or some cheap Vr glasses you can buy at the Action. It is an app were you have to put on somethun g like glasses to get imersed into a new world. 
			</p>
			<h3>Process</h3>
				<h4>Day one</h4>
				<p>
					On the first day of the lab weeks we started with a start up meeting where in Chris told us what the next two weeks were going to be like. After that you had to look which topic and group you were assigned to for the labweeks. My group was a group of four people because the fifth person didn't folow the course anymore. So once I found my group we introduced our selfs and started talking about what we wanted to do. So we started brainstorming and talked about what we wanted to do, if we wanted to do AR or VR. After that we talked about what kind of concepts we wanted to do we came up with different ideas for AR and VR concept, so to decide which way we wanted to go we did research on what kind of software there was available to work with. 
					<br>
					<br>
					For augmented reality there are multiply ways to create apps. You have ARKIt which is an AR toolkit for IOS but not available in the Netherlands.You have ar.js were you can create AR stuff using markers. These markers you can also make yourself. There is also three.js that is more advanced then ar.js. You have Google AR where there is an version for android and IOS were you can make AR worlds using JavaScript. 
					<br>
					<br>
					For Virtual Reality you can work with software like Unity and Unreal Engine were professional games are made with. 
					<br>
					With the information we found together we decided to go with Augmented Reality because there were more different softwares to work with and more ways to make it an interactive instalation.

				<h4>Day Two</h4>
				<p>
					On the second day we did a daily stand up were we discused what we did yesterday and what our plans were for this day so we kept each other informed about what we were doing and what still needed to be done. Because it was only the second day I continued with looking for different softwares we could use to make an AR app with. First I found three.js and started looking at how we could work with this program, while I was looking at it I found out that it was a really difficult software and that it was mostly used to make interactive websites. After that I looked at ARcore which is an android based AR program, it sounded really interessting and easy to work with so I downloaded Android Studios to work with but because of the WIFI it was going to take a while to download. While it was downloading we had an guest lecture from Vincent of the company Next Empire that works with AR and did a really cool sculpture for the Efteling. After the guest lecture Android Studios downloaded and it looked really interessting. We decided we wanted to work with markers and to make them or put them in a game we needed software. So that was our next task while doing research we found the software Vuforia were you could upload markers on and then put them into a program like Unity. So we talked and decided that we wanted to work with the following programs: Android Studios, Vuforia and Unity to make our game. I had to redownload Unity for it to work with Android Studio and Vuforia because I had an older version on my computer so it couldn't run some of the software we needed. After that we tried to put an marker into an Unity with the help of Vuforia after some trail and error we finally got it to work. At first we tried it with a marker I made in Illustrator, we printed it out and when we held the phone over it the character stood on the marker.

				<h4>Day three</h4>
				<p>
					On the third day we started with a guest lecture in the morning, after this lecture we did our daily stand up agian talking about what the other did and what our goals was fot that day. I wanted to make the 3d characters we were going to use in our game so I started looking at different softwares that are available to make 3d characters with. First I found the software sketch up which a free program were you can make 3d models in. I tried to make a ghost characters because our theme is the Ghostbusters. But the quality of the models in sketch up wasn't what we wanted them to be so I started looking for a different software. I found Cinema 4D so I decided to try and work with that and downloaded the trail version of Cinema 4d. Later I learned that there was a free version for students so I aplied for that so I had to wait to hear back that I could download the student version. After that I started looking for a tutorial on YouTube on how to make a ghost character and I found one. So with the tutorial I started working on the ghost step by step. Once I was almost done and the day was almost over I messed up the point of view on my screen and in turn messed up the ghost so I had to stop and redo the whole thing the next day. After that we got together and looked at what we did and changed the scrum board acording to what was finished that day.

				<h4>Day four</h4>
				<p>
					On the fourth day we started our day with the daily stand up and started talking about what we all did the day before. I told them I had to remake the 3d model I was working on because I messed up the view in Cinema 4D. I also said that I wanted to foucs on making 3d models and to make a studio set up so I could render the project. After the daily stand up we started with a lecture from Teun Verkerk about artifcial creatures. He showed us his work and what kind of projects he did. The project that stood most out to me was the project about the kind bug artificial creatures that could communicate with eachother by sound. He brought some of them with him and seeing how they worked in real life really cool. They made weird noise and lit up but they were communicating when one of them made a noise the other one reacted to the first one with another noise. It made me realise how cool artificial creatures are and that we can make very simple things that can do intrecate things. 
					<br>
					<br>
					After the lecture I went to Seda because she had worked with Cinema 4d before and asked how I could fix the view in the software. I thought because I restarted the program the view would be back to normal but it wasn't, so with her help I got the view back to normal. She explained to me how the view worked and how I could use it best while I was working with the problem. What she told really helped me understand the program better. Right after I started working on the model for a second time and this time went better, I asked the group if it was looking good and if they had any suggestions about how the ghost should look. They said I should try to make it look more scary and Ghostbuster like, so I made the ghost green because the ghost in Ghostbusters are green and I gave the ghost red eyes to make it more creepy. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I couldn't render the ghost right away so I started working on a study rig to help the ghost render with better quality. In the tutorial I was watching for the ghost I saw that they were also working with a studio rig, so I looked up a tutorial on how to make an studio rig. I first whatched the tutorial all the way through and then I started copying step by step what the person in the tutorial did the way I could do it in my version of Cinema 4d. Making a studio rig is a lot of work so by the end of the day I wasn't even halfway done because it was really hard and I messed up a couple of times with some of the steps, so I had to redo them.

				<h4>Day five</h4>
				<p>
					On the fifth day I got in late because I had to go to a famliy thing that I really wanted to go to so I came in around 12 o'clock. The moment I got I started working on the studio rig so I could render the 3d model. The rendering wasn't goign well and I didn't know how to do it properly so I once again asked if Seda could help me on how to render the model. She told me that the studio rig wasn't necessary to render a model so now I had a studio rig i didn't need but was fun to learn how to make. Seda helped me figure out on how to export the model so we could place it in Unity. Once the model was imported in /unity we saw that it didn't look like the model I made but was the components floating seperatly mid air in the game. So I started looking for away we could export the ghost and still had it shaped as the ghost I made in Cinema 4d and not the floating things. I did for the remainder of the day but I really couldn't find anything. 
					<br>
					<br>
					So on the weekend I looked if I could find anything but still no luck. So I made two markers to make up for the fact that I couldn't figure out how to make the model export correctly. I also asked Seda but she didn't know what the problem was and so also didn't know how to fix it, it was really nice of her to help me think of a way to fix. So because we couldn't have the first ghost I made, I made a second one a different way then the first one to see if we could use this one instead in Unity.

				<h4>Day six</h4>
				<p>
					On the sixth day I started the day with showing the group the model I made over the weekend, they liked but found it a bit to simple. With the feedback in mind I started looking up tutrials on making ghosts in Cinema 4d again and it was mostly animation and that wasn't going to work as we saw with making the first ghost I used a bit of animation, I think, to drop the cloth over the circle and that didn't work out in Unity. So I told the rest of the group that so we decided to stick with the ghost I made over the weekend. After that I started working on other models for Unity. First I looked up ghosts from Ghostbuster and I saw the stay pufft marshmallow ghost and thought it would be fun to recreate this ghost. So I looked up refrence photo's on what would be the best way to recreate it would be, I found the photo of the Funko version of the marshmallow ghost and decided to recreate that one. After I made the marshmallow ghost I made a cube like monster because I thought it would be fun to have weird sized monster. After the cube ghost I made an eye because I thought it would be fun and creepy to have a floating eye. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Once I was done making the models I put them on our google drive so Lars could import them into Unity so we could use them in the game. I made a design for our decor what we could do to make it look like. After that I started working on more markers for the shooting range and Lars figured out how to make the game start counting points once you shoot at it. I brought a phone that we could use to put the game on so that nodbodies phone had to be used during the expo.

				<h4>Day seven</h4>
				<p>
					On the seventh day i made a sketch on paper on what I wanted the targets to look like with the targets I made in illustrator as refrence point. After that Lars and I went to Gamma to get wood to make the shooting range. After we came back from Gamma Lars started cutting out the squares for the targets so we could eventually start painting. While Lars was cutting out the targets Babette and I went to Gamma again to get paint to paint the frames and the squares we got balck and white paint. After he was done Babette and I stated painting the frames and the squares for the first coat because the wood we got soaked up the paint so we had to do several layers. So we had to let everyhting dry for the day. So this day was more of a hands on day we mad a lot of stuff.

				</figure>
				<h4>Day eight</h4>
				<p>
					On the eight day we put a second coat of paint on the frames and the squares of the targets so they had enough time to dry. After the squares were dry we taped them up in the way of the targets, Babette and I painted the spots in the tape white so we had markers to put in Unity. Once the markers were painted we waited for them to dry some more, while we were waiting for it to dry Lars drilled holes in the now dry frames so we could start to assemble the frame. Lars started putten the frames together and we peeled the tape of the now dry markers and we drilled holes in the markers so we could attach it to the frame. After that the three of us started to assemble the free, we used pins and elastic to atach the markers to the frame so they would hang in between the frames and the sensor that will put on the back would feel that there was a dart shot at. This was a struggle because it wasn't easy to get the elastic throught the holes and if you pushed the pins in to deep you could prick your self in the finger. Once that was done we put the installation on a table because on the floor it was to low, once it was on the table we put the sensors on the backs of the markers and we did a test run with the app on the nerf gun to see if it worked and it did. But the some of the 3d models I made didn't go so work so well in the game so we had to find similair or different 3d models for the once that didn't work so that the app would work.

				<h4>Day nine</h4>
				<p>
					On the ninth and final day it was all about finishing the last things to perfect the installation. We decided we wanted to add a scoreboard so we could keep track of who hit the most targets. So Babette and Lars went to get chalkboard paint so we could write on the paint and wipe it. While they were gone I tried to figure out how we could get the phone to connect to the bluetooth part of the arduino because it wasn't able to connect with it. I tried a bunch of different things but that didn't work so I asked a teacher knew what was wrong and we found something but for it to see if it was working I had to wait until Lars was because he had the code. After he was back we tried it but I didn't work so we decided to use Lars his phone because we knew it would work. In the meanwhile Babette made a scoreboard for the installation and we attached that and it worked with the chalkboard paint because before we put it on the frame it self but that didn't work because of the texture of the board. Around three o'clock we were done and was it time to eat because at four the expo would start. A lot of people came to our installation and seemed to really like it, the only thing we underestimated was how many timees we had to pick up the nerf darts that fell on the ground after shooting them. Kids really liked our installation and was fun to see them shoot at the target and miss or see how excited they'd get if they hit the target. Around eight o'clock the expo was done and we had to clean up. We destroyed our installation because nobody could take it home. All in all it was a really fun night and our installation did really wel and i was proud to say i worked on it and it was fun to see what everybody else had created.

			<h3>Product</h3>
				<p>
					Our product is an AR Nerf shooting range were you look through a phone to see what your target is. Our group had the topic AR and VR and we made the decision to make an AR game. We wanted to make a game were you had to look through the phone to see what is on the target were you had to shoot at. The product relates to the topic AR and VR because for it to work we made real life makers that we put in Unity, we used this to make the app with Vuforia, so the phone could detect the markers and you would see what your target was. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The product works as following: we put sensors on the back of our markers that were connected to an ardruino that worked together with Unity. With the arduino connected to Unity we could see when the target was hit and you if got a point. The app was made with Unity and Vuforia was the software we used to put it on a phone so the app could be used. Once the app was opened and you focus on the markers targets apeared that we got from the internet our were made by me with Cinema 4d. When you put the phone on Nerf gun it gets easier to shoot because you don't have to hold the phone. When you point the gun at the markers the targets will apear on your screen and now you can play the game.

			<h3>Reflect</h3>
				<p>
					I am contend with the product we delivered at the end it was a lot of work and hoping it would work but it was fun to do in the end. We worked together and made an awesome product together that worked and people really liked. I did exactly what we wanted it to do, it didn't run as smoothly as we wanted but at the end of the day it worked and it was fun to learn some new programs to work with. 
					<br>
					The quality of our product is good the markers we made were recognizable by the phone, some of the targets that I made worked and the others we got from Unity worked to. Only the point systeem didn't work as good because it kept counting even when we restarted the game sometimes. Somtimes the nerf gun jammed but that was because there were to many bullets in the gun or they weren't put in the gun properly.
				</p>
				<p>
					We all worked really hard on the project at first it was more evenly spread because we were with four people but once the fourth one also stopped and we were with a group of three people it became a bit harder because we had to do the workload of five people with three people. I think everybody did as much as they could and were they were good at but sometimes others did more than other people. I think I worked hard I started working with a new program so that we could make our own 3d models and I made sure we had ideas for several markers we could paint once we were at that point. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I think I spent my time working on our project rarelu thought that i wasn't doing something that wasn't for the project and I was always busy trying to help or doing my own thing so could get a step further to our final goal. I made sure I was always doing something was that talking with the group about something i didn't know or another student that knew something about the software I was working on or helping another student from another group with something they didn't get. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I was very motivated this time around for the HCI labweeks i really liked to topic I got to work with and my group and I came up with a fun concept that turned into reality. My expactations were met, sometimes I thought we couldn't get it done with just three people but we made it work and had an awesome project at the end of it and I had a lot of fun making it. I learned a lot during these two weeks, I learned to work with a new software were I thought I would never work with and I learned that I can be really creative and come up with random patterns to make markers that a software can read. Besides that I learned that artificial creatures are really interessting and I would like to learn more about in the future and that AR is a fun way to make an interactive enviroment without forgetting the real world.
