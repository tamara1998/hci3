			<h1>Excusrion: NEMO Science Museum</h1>

				<p>
					On monday the 27th of May 2019 I went to NEMO in Amsterdam. NEMO is an interactive science and technology museum for kids. In NEMO you explore the world of science and technology through fun experiments and interactive installations. The goal of NEMO is to make kids excited to learn about science and different technologies.
				</p>
				<h3>Assignment</h3>
					<p>
						While I was in to museum I got to see a lot of interesting instalations but I wasn't there just to have fun. The school gave us an assignment to look for an installation to caught our interest and you had to explain this installation caught your interest.
					</p>
				 	<p>
				 		The installations that caught my interest is the Protect the Earth Installation at NEMO. This installation has the goal to make children interact with each other in a playful way with the same goal of protecting the virtual world they see in front of them. The installation is a projection onto a wall where you see earth and from space projectiles are shot at it. The children have to hold up boards that will form a blockade that has to protect earth from the projectiles. The more projectiles they block the bigger their board will get in the game and the more space they get to protect the earth. 
				 	</p>
				 	<p>
				 		The installations works as following: to interact with the game you have to hold a board that has squares on it so the sensor can differentiate the different boards from each other. There are two sensors right above the game one is to track the boards that are being used to play the game the other one is a motion sensor that tracks the movements the children make to place the boards correctly in the game. To project the game onto the wall there are two beamers to project it. One is for the game and everything that happens in the game, the other one is for the shields. The second beamer places the boards the children are holding as shields into the game. 
				 	</p>
				 	<p>
				 		I find the installation interesting because it stimulates kids to think about protecting the earth in a fun way. It is easy to understand how the installation works and you don’t have to think about what you have to do. Because it is this way it is perfect for kids because they don’t like a lot of text and just want to do stuff. What I also find interesting that it uses motion sensors to track what it is going on with the players.

				<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>
						The excursion was very fun to do, it was the first time i wen t to NEMO. It was also a way to unwind from the normal school days because I got to play around with some awesome things while I was there. What I learned is that there are a lot of different ways to learn kids new things in an interactive and fun way. Also that those ways can also be fun for older people. What spoke to me was that every kid I saw was having fun with what they were doing and that they were learning without knowing that they were learning something new. The excursion was valuable because I got to see interactive design in a new light and that it can have a fun element and doesn't have to be intrecate to be fun but can be very simple.
