			<h3>Assignment</h3>
				<p>
					The second workshop I had for HCI was VR enviroment, in this workshop we looked at two different softwares were you could build two different kinds of enviroments with. The first software I started working with was Madmapper because you have to use a beamer to work with this software and some atributes they only had available at school. So I worked together with Seda and Emma on Madmapper because it would be easier to do together and this way the whole class doesn't need it's own beamer per student. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Madmapper is a software were you can project a picture onto an object that is standing in front of the beamer. You can map the object in the software to have it align correctly with the object you are projecting it on to with out it looking funny. That is in short what Madmapper does from the perspective of a girl who has worked with it only once.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first steps to this workshop was to grab one of the IMac's that were available in the classroom and a beamer. It took a while to get started because we didn't have the right password to log in too the IMac. While we were waiting we connected the beamer to the IMac so we could get started right away once we had the password. Once the software was started and the projector was connected we used the standard square to test the software out. We started playing arround in the software with the quad that showed in the program and tried something fun. Once we had to start projecting what we had been playing with it started to get harder because getting that on the projector wasn't that easy, with the help of the teacher we got it to work and was it time to start doing the actual assignment.

				<p>
					We had to import a image of our own to start doing the assignment and because we were using a foam head we decided to do the face of a monkey to project onto the head. We used a image we found on google and put it into Madmapper, we cropped so that it would fit on the head. This worked and once we were fine with how it looked we projected and it looked really fun.

				<p>
					After simply putting a image on the head we had to make it interactive we watched the video on how to do it and after that we decided that we wanted the image to responded to sound by blinking on and off while there was sound. We reduced the opacity if the image and added the audio input so when we started banging on the table the image would flicker.

				<p>
					For the last assignment we had to make an interactive projection with one of the objects they had for this assignment. We decided to use the same way of interactive projecting as in the assignment before this one, but instead of banging on the table we made it interacte with a song so it would blink along on the melody of the song that was playing. You can see how this played out in the video below.

				<p>
					After the Madmapper assignment was finished I went on too the next part of the VR enviroment workshop and that was the Unreal Engine assignment. To do this assignment you had to have Unreal Engine downloaded on your computer before hand because it was a really big file and could take a while to download if you had to do that at school. So I downloaded it at home so I could get started right away once I had to do this assignment. For this part of the VR enviroment workshop you had to acquiant yourself with Unreal Engine by creating a simple interactive virtual environment.
				</p>

				<p>
					So the first part of the Unreal Engine assignment is to make a banana turn on a turntable. To make this there was a link provided by the school were you could do this step by step. The first step was to impirt the banana model and the banana texture, once you had done that you had to drag the banana model into the enviroment and now you had a banana.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you had a banana you had to add a material to it to make it look like a banana otherwise it would be grey blob to do this you had tp create a new material. You had to make it using nodes so you could connect the different parts to each other. Once you had a material you had to make a texture so you could put it on the banana. Once you had made the texture you could put it on the grey banana and then you have a banana that looks like a actual banana.

				</figure>
				<p>
					After giving the banana color you had to make a blueprint that start making the turntable for your banana. This you did by pressing the blueprint button in the content browser, when you create a blueprint you have to decide what kind you want and for a turntable it was recommended to choose the actor class. Once you had the bluerpint you had to click on it to start editing it, to make the turntable you had to use a cylinder of a seize of your chosing and a static mesh. Once you had those two you could add the banana, but you have to make sure you don't have your cylinder still selected because then your banana would be wonky. Too display the banana you had to go too the details section of the static mesh and there you had to select Banana_Model as the static mesh. To make the turntable spin you had to attach the addLocalRotation to your Default Scene Root so you could make the banana turn. This you had to link to an Event Tick to make it work properly after that you have to compile the blueprint and go make to the main editor and then delete the first banana and then you have your banana turntable.

				<p>
					For the second part of the Unreal Engine assignment you had to open the BananaCollector.uproject to make a banana collecting game. First you had to create a player which again had to be done with the bluepring class and this time it had to be a pawn to play with. Once you had the player you had too attach a camera too it so you could follow it easier when you  are playing the game. You had to point the camera at the player from above so you had to turn it a total of 60 degrees. Once you were done with that you had to make the player because now it was a grey orb, you had to do it the same way as with the banana from the banana turntable assignment and go to static mesh and select SM_Cube to be your static mesh. Once you did this you had a red cube for a player. To use the player you had to spawn it, you had to do this by creating a game mode were GM_Tutorial would be your pawn class default. Then you had to go to the details section and choose BP_Player as the default pawn. You had to compile al of this and then you had to change the world settings to be GM_Tutorial to make the game work.
				</p>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<p>
					Once you had done al of that you had too see if it al worked and you had to place the Player Start in the game space to see if it would place the cube. You can't move around just yet so you have to put inputs in there to make the cube move. To do this you have to go to the edit/project settings and chose input under the engine section. Once you are in this section you have to click on axis mapping to start mapping the keys you want to use to move your cube around, you had to choose W, A, S and D as the keys. You had to change the scale for the S and A keys to -1.0. 
					<br>
					<br>
					After you did all of this came the fun part and make the pawn move and this you have to do with the nodes again so bacn to the event graph were we can start doing this. You had to add the folowing nodes: MoveForward and MoveRight. Once that was done you had to make a variable MaxSpeed were the nodes could interact with this had to be a float variable so that it would be easier to work with. After adding MaxSpeed you had to add the float * float node, then you had to add the Get Actor Forward Vector node to move the actor forward, then you add the Add Movement Input node to make the pawn move. The same actions had to be repeated for the MoveRight node exactly the same, once that was done you had too add the Event Tick, Consume Movement Input Vector and AddLocalOffSet and this makes the pawn actually move. 
					<br>
					<br>
					There is only one small problem left you can move through everything now and that is something you don't want. So I had to change the Frame Rate Indenpendence, I had to do this with adding a vector * float to the off set that would mutliply the delta seconds so that it moves a lot slower so I had to change the MaxSpeed to 600. After that I had to add Collision so that it stopped going through everything, this you had to do enabling sweep and now you can't move through things. But it wasn't perfect yet so I had to set the Collision Response I had to change the BlockAllDynamic to costum so I could change the WorldDynamic to overlap. After that I had to add the OnComponentBeginOverlap and attach an DestroyActor to it stop the cube moving through things.

					Once all of that was done the only thing that was left to do was placing the bananas in the game and then play it.
