			<h3>Assignment</h3>
			<p>
				The last workshop I had for HCI was the Computer Vision workshop, in this workshop I worked with the software Processing. Processing is a program were you can make shapes and animations in. Besides that you can also make use of the libraries that are in the program were you can try somethings for example you can track via your camera and place things on peoples faces. During the workshop I learned the basics of the program how you can draw shapes and how you can animate these shapes and as last I learned how to use the tracker. It was a really fun workshop and I learned to work with a cool program that has so many posibilities and things that you can try and it is fun to learn how to work with a new program.

				Before the first assignment you learned how to draw ellipses and how to place them in Processing and how to change their colors and their positions. So for the first assignment you had to draw three or more ellipses in various locations, in various colors. with various widths and heights and with and withour borders. So I made three ellipses in three different colors, sizes and different borders. The first ellipse is pastel pink without a border, the second ellipse is pastel purple with a red border and the third ellipse is a pastel green with a black border.

					After the first assignment I learned to draw different shapes then ellipses with Processing like a line, a triangle, quad and a rectangle. First it was explained how you had to draw a line and how you could make how you wanted it too look like. So for the second assignment I had to draw at least four shapes (no circles), in various colors and at various locations. So i drew four different shapes in various locations and in various colors. First I drew a simple black line, then I drew a triangle in pastel green, a rectangle in pastel purple with a thick white border and at last I drew a ellipse in hot pink. All these shapes are in different locations as you can see in the picture below.

					After the second assignment you learned to work with variables and how to apply them in your processing code, this way you influence the shapes you draw more because you can influence more then just the size you can alse change diameter of you shapes and it makes a difrence. After learning how to work with variables I learned how to add interactivity to the shapes you draw in processing. This way you can make shapes folow your mouse or make to grow lager the longer the program is running once you press play. So for the third assignment you had to draw at least three different shapes with various colors and make them interactive. I drew a ellipse and a line that followed the mouse once you moved you mouse and depending on the position of the ellipse it would change color. You can see how it works in the video down below.

					After the third assignment I had to download to zip file's so I could work with Processing and Computer Vision. So after downloading them you had to test the files you downloaded and could play around a bit while doing the testing. 
					<br>
					For the first Computer Vision I had to change the code so that instead of an rectangle you saw an circle around the persons face. For the second Computer Vision assignment I had to adjust the code so instead of an circle you saw an black bar before the eyes or an red clown nose. I went with the red clown nose. For the last Computer Vision assignment you had to change the code so that something cool would happen but I couldn't figure out how to do that so I don't have this assignment. Down below you can see the codes for the assignments I did do and an picture showing what I did.

					For the last assignment you had to use processing with markers and then hold them infront of your camera using the library processing provided. The whole course I had troubles with my webcam and processing and I hoped it was going to work this time around but unfortunately it didn't but I still tried in the picture down below you can see that the code isn't working I tried it multiple times and it kept saying the same.
