			<h3>Assignment</h3>
				 <p>
				 	For the assignment we have to choose between two cases and think about an wearable concept how you can use this. I am choosing the case were you have to think about a concept that is based on biometric brainwave data of people in the same room. 
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 	My concept is a wearable that you wear on wrist that uses the blockchain system to download and share the  information about the users when they are on the same WIFI and in the same room as you. Through WIFI and GPS your wearable will connect with other users. These are two of the three sensors the wearable uses. The other one is an EEG sensor that uses your brainwaves to light one of the three lights on your wearable. The blue is for approachable, purple is for a possible friendship/connection and the pink one is not approachable. These lights are activated the closer you get to a user. If you can approach them or make an connection you will get to see the name of the user on the screen of the device and one thing you have in common. The lights in combination with an slight vibration will alert the user of the possible match to social interaction. 
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 	The device is made of an rubber material that fits comfortably on the users wrist. It’s a slim device so that it doesn’t take up too much space on your wrist and you don’t actually notice it all that much when you are wearing it. The color of the device is black so you can wear it with everything without it standing out to much.

			<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>
					So for the research part for wearables I decided to look into the technology that I want to use in my design for the wearable. So I found this article that I used to find information on biometrics so I knew what I was talking about for my concept. In this article I also found information on blockchains used with wearbales and biometrics. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The article talks about that in the future wearables such as apple watches will be linked to biometric systems that will monitor health conditions using blockchains. 
					Then it talks about what blockchain is. Blockchain is orginaly used to facilitate transfers of virtual currency, think about bitcoin, blockchain helps to make these transfers safer. Blockchain keeps track of everything so companys don't have to worry about transactions between different banks for instance. Blockchain will keep track of that. 
					With a blockchain system every connected device needs to have a copy of the database so that you can use it. But on a wearable you dont have a lot of storage space to store this so to counter this they came up with a specialized blockchain were you dont have to store the whole scope of the database. So it is possible to use blockchain on wearable devices. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Then the article starts talking about wearable tech and explains that wearables are electronic devices that can be worn. An example of an wearbale is an apple watch or an fitbit. At the moment wearables are mostly used to keep track of your health but I think that in the future wearables will be able to do so much more. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Now we are getting to the interessting part of the article were it talks about biometrics. Biometrics are described as being "unique physical characteristics" that can be used for "automated recognition" by the Department Of Homeland Security in the U.S. So when you think about biometrics think about fingerprint scans, face recognition, iris scans and voice recognition. These biometerics are unique to you and they can't easily be coppied. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With the information I read in this article I think it is possible that in a few years we are using more advanced wearables then now. They will have more functions then keeping track of your health and will be able to use biometric information from it's users that is stored in a blockchain database. for the full atricle you can <a href="https://www.healthsplash.com/blog/the-holy-trinity-blockchain-wearables-and-biometrics/">click here</a>.

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					I think wearables are becoming more prominent in everybodies day to day lives. Just this year I started using an apple watch and it really makes things more efficent. I don't have to look at my phone when I get a message I just see it on my watch. It blows my mind that something so small can do all of that and that I am already getting dependend on it. This just the present think about how important wearables could become in the future to make peoples lives easier. 
					The most valuable aspect of this topic is that anything is possible if you know were to find the information and you can dream big enough to make it a reallity.
